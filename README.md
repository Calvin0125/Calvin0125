- 👋 Hi, I’m @Calvin0125
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and creating tools that help people use the internet more effectively. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend and backend web development. Right now I'm using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap, 
     and I'm also making an effort to learn more about VIM and bash scripting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web development project using Ruby on Rails, but will not be available until September 2021. 
- 📫 How to reach me: cconley0125@gmail.com.
