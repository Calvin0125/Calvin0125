- 👋 Hi, I’m @Calvin0125
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and creating tools that help people use the internet more effectively. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend and backend web development. Right now I'm using Ruby on Rails and Vue, 
     and I recently learned Python and Django. I have also done work involving AWS Lambda, external APIs, and Slack Workflows triggered by webhook URLs.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a backend software development job focusing on Rails or Django applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: cconley0125@gmail.com.
